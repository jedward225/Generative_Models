## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation and comparative analysis of state-of-the-art deep generative models for distribution learning and sample generation. The project explores multiple cutting-edge architectures to understand their theoretical foundations, implementation nuances, and practical performance in modeling complex data distributions.

The implemented models represent the evolution of generative AI research, from traditional approaches like GANs to the more recent diffusion-based models that have revolutionized the field of generative modeling.

## 🚀 Implemented Models

This project implements four major families of generative models:

### 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- Fully implemented encoder-decoder architecture with reparameterization trick
- Optimized ELBO loss function with KL divergence regularization
- Flexible latent space dimensionality for different modeling capacities

### 2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Robust implementation with optimized generator and discriminator networks
- BCE loss function with adaptive training schemes
- Stable training dynamics through careful hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
- Forward and reverse diffusion processes with predefined noise schedules
- Sinusoidal time embeddings for effective timestep conditioning
- MSE loss for noise prediction with high-quality sample generation

### 4. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)
- Accelerated sampling with deterministic non-Markovian processes
- Configurable number of sampling steps for quality-speed tradeoffs
- Implementation of stochasticity parameter (η) for controlling randomness

## 📊 Data

The project uses synthetic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) datasets for training and evaluation, providing a clear visual representation of how each model learns complex multimodal distributions. This synthetic data approach allows for:

- Controlled complexity testing

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The generative models are comprehensively evaluated using:

- Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for measuring sample quality
- KL Divergence for distribution matching assessment
- Visual inspection of generated vs. real data distributions
- Comparative training dynamics and convergence rates
